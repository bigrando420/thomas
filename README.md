# Thomas the Game Engine
Big bloaty game engine with lots of overhead? Me no like.

Small lightweight game engine with bare essentials for making games at the speed of light? Now that... *me likey.*

This bad boy is a bullet train built in C-style C++ that's fueled by simplicity and practicality.

## Notes
- You can only build from source on Windows, since I've already built and included the Telescope .dll for linking

## FAQ
### Can I use this?
Yup. Use it however tf you want (excluding the `third_party` of course). Rip out whatever parts would be handy for your own toolset, or just flat out fork and extend the engine, no need to credit me.

All I ask is that if you have a handy idea for simplifying something, open an issue with some examples & resources and we'll have a chat about it.

All of the really nice smart stuff in this engine is derived from giants who I've learnt from, all credit goes towards them. All of the silly stuff, you can assume is my error, which will get corrected as I evolve as a programmer.

## TODO
- [ ] project logo - thomas the tank engine as a bullet train lmfao (contact@randy.gg if you're keen)
- [ ] list of inspiration with links. Ryan Fleury, Casey Muratori (handmade hero), Randy Gaul, Allen Webster, John Carmack, etc.
